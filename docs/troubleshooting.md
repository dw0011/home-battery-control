# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

---

## Dashboard Shows No Data

**Symptoms**: HBC panel loads but shows blank cards or "N/A" values.

**Causes**:
1. **Sensor entities not configured correctly** — Check Settings → Devices → House Battery Control and verify all configured entities show valid states (not "unavailable" or "unknown")
2. **Integration not loaded** — Check HA logs for `house_battery_control` errors: Settings → System → Logs → search for `hbc`
3. **First run delay** — The integration needs one full 5-minute cycle to populate data. Wait 5 minutes after initial setup.

**Fix**: Verify your entity IDs are correct in the integration options. The most common mistake is selecting the wrong entity from a list of similarly-named sensors.

## FSM Is Stuck in IDLE

**Symptoms**: `sensor.hbc_state` shows "IDLE" permanently, no battery commands are sent.

**Causes**:
1. **No tariff data** — The Amber Electric integration isn't providing forecast data. Check that your import/export price sensors have a `forecast` attribute with future prices.
2. **No solar forecast** — Solcast sensors are empty. Check that `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today` has a `forecast` attribute.
3. **Solver finds inaction optimal** — If prices are flat and solar is zero, IDLE may genuinely be the optimal choice.
4. **No control scripts configured** — HBC is in observation/debug mode. Configure scripts in Step 3 to enable control.

**Fix**: Navigate to `/hbc/api/status` (admin auth required) and check the `sensor_diagnostics` section for any sensors showing `available: false`.

## Battery Power Shows Wrong Direction

**Symptoms**: The power flow diagram shows the battery charging when it's actually discharging, or vice versa.

**Fix**: Toggle the **Invert Battery Power** option in Settings → Integrations → House Battery Control → Configure → Telemetry.

Different inverter brands report power direction differently. Positive values should mean discharging (power flowing out of battery). If your sensor reports charging as positive, enable inversion.

## Grid Power Direction Is Wrong

**Symptoms**: Grid import shows as export on the dashboard, or vice versa.

**Fix**: Toggle the **Invert Grid Power** option in Telemetry settings. The convention is positive = importing from grid.

## Panel Not Visible in Sidebar

**Symptoms**: After installation, there's no "HBC" entry in the left sidebar.

**Causes**:
1. **Admin-only mode** — By default, the panel is only visible to admin users. Check you're logged in as an admin.
2. **Panel visibility setting** — Go to Configure → Control Services and check the "Panel Visible to Admins Only" toggle. Turn it OFF to make the panel visible to all users.
3. **Integration not loaded** — Check Settings → Devices & Services for the House Battery Control card.

## 401 Unauthorized on API Endpoints

**Symptoms**: Visiting `/hbc/api/status` or `/hbc/api/ping` returns "401: Unauthorized".

**This is expected behaviour.** All HBC API endpoints require admin authentication. Access them through the HBC panel (which handles auth automatically) or use a valid Bearer token.

## Sensors Show "Unavailable"

**Symptoms**: HBC sensors show "unavailable" in the entity list.

**Causes**:
1. **Prerequisite integration not set up** — HBC depends on Amber Electric, Solcast, and Tesla integrations. If any are missing or misconfigured, their sensors will be unavailable.
2. **Entity ID changed** — If you renamed or reconfigured a prerequisite integration, the entity IDs may have changed. Update them in HBC's configuration.
3. **Integration error** — Check HA logs for `house_battery_control` ERROR entries.

**Fix**: Go to Settings → Integrations → House Battery Control → Configure and verify all entity IDs are valid.
